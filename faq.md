- question: Rapid-fire questions
  answer: 'Q: How should I care for your jewelry? <br /> A: In jewelry making, natural
    gemstones are often heated or treated using traditional techniques to enhance
    their color. Cultured freshwater pearls occur in a variety of colors and are sometimes
    dyed to create pleasing effects. Most treatments of gems and cultured pearls are
    permanent, requiring little or no special care. Sterling silver parts may tarnish
    when not worn very often. Use a jeweler’s cloth to polish as required. <br /><br
    /> Q: Is your jewelry water proof? <br /> A: Yes it generally is, however some
    pieces with wooden beads should not be submerged in water. <br /><br /> Q: Is
    the gold and silver solid? <br /> A: Yes, the silver parts are solid Sterling
    silver. The gold tube beads are gold-filled, that is the term used for high quality
    gold-plating on Sterling silver. <br /><br /> Q: Will you create custom orders
    for weddings? <br /> A: Yes! We''d love to hear from you about your plans. Just
    write us at jewelry(at)helensuter.studio with your inquiry and we''d be delighted
    to develop an individualized look in our signature style.  <br /><br /> Q: Can
    I sell your jewelry in my shop? <br /> A: Yes! Write me at jewelry(at)helensuter.studio
    and let me know what you are interested in carrying in your store. <br /><br />
    Q: Are you an artist as well? <br /> A: Yes, I am a trained metal sculptor and
    work in many different materials. You can find my work at [helensuter.studio](helensuter.studio)
