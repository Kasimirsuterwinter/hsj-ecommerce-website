title: About
headline: Helen Suter Jewelry
introduction: A line of comfortable, modern jewelry designed and made in the Hudson
  Valley by sculptor Helen Suter. Materials from nature are combined with 14/20 gold-filled,
  Sterling silver and various patina plated tubular components. Helen uses semi-precious
  healing stones, crystals, pearls, Czech cut glass, metal and wood beads. The elegant
  and minimalist warm aesthetic of the bracelets, necklaces and rings is complemented
  by ease of wear due to the use of nylon stretch cord. A majority of pieces, including
  earrings, are one of a kind. Pure eye candy for work and play!
