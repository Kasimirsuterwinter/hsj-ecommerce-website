title: About
headline: Helen Suter Jewelry
introduction: A line of comfortable, modern jewelry designed and made in the Hudson
  Valley by sculptor Helen Suter. Materials from nature are combined with 14/20 gold-filled,
  Sterling silver and various patina plated tubular components. Helen uses semi-precious
  healing stones, crystals, pearls, Czech cut glass, metal and wood beads. The elegant
  and minimalist aesthetic is complemented by the warmth of the natural materials
  and ease of wear due to the use of nylon stretch cord. A majority of pieces, including
  earrings, are one of a kind. Pure eye candy for work and play!

- title: Natural Materials
  description: 'My jewelry is created using beads made from materials occurring in
    nature. Many of the semi-precious stones are reputed to have healing properties
    when worn. I look for the unusual in all of my compositions. Subtle movement of
    the curved metal beads complements the wearer''s personal movement. Stemming from
    my respect for the beauty of the natural world, I like to enhance not only a sense
    of beauty, but a sense of personal wellness. '

- title: Made in the Hudson Valley
  description: 'After living in several interesting places across the world, I settled
    in the beautiful Hudson Valley. I take great inspiration from the local artistic
    history, especially the well-known 19th century American painter, Fredrick Edwin
    Church, who created his home Olana atop a hill and painted the views across the
    Hudson River. New artistic venues are appearing, enhancing the nature experience,
    such as The School in Kinderhook. Many artists and makers produce locally.  '
